# History lesson

###### (quick)

```notes
- Created 2012 by Dan Schafer, Nick Schrock and Lee Byron

- Around this time the whole industry was shifting to mobile

- GraphQL was created by Facebook get only the data needed into React components for the iOS app.

- Open Sourced 2015

- Single endpoint

- Hierarchical: Another important aspect of GraphQL is its hierarchical nature.

- GraphQL naturally follows relationships between objects

- a RESTful service may require multiple round-trips (resource-intensive on mobile networks)

- or a complex join statement in SQL.

```notes
- The difference is how you send the request to them
- REST APIs URL Driven
  - POST /user {name:'Scott'}
- GraphQL APIs Query Driven
  - POST /graphql {query:'query'}

Example, imagine your REST API is a vending machine and each piece of
data is one item on there you have to select individually and collect.

With GraphQL it enables a shopping list so you can get everything in
one go

## Since 2010

```notes
- Perf has been a factor in it's ranking algorithm

- That's not news, people are using mobile devices a lot more now,
  there are two indexes, desktop and mobile

# What's GraphQL? 🤔

---

# It's not

---

A library or a framework.

---

A database technology.

---

# It is

---

A query language.

```notes
  <h4>What else would the QL stand for?</h4>
```

---

For querying APIs

---

A single endpoint for your data

---

Named terribly

---

A great way to see the shape of your data
