```notes
- As a show of hands who knows why GraphQL exists?
```

---

# What's GraphQL? ü§î

---

# It's not

---

A library or a framework.

---

A database technology.

---

# It is

---

A query language.

```notes
- What else would the QL stand for?
```

---

For querying APIs

---

A single endpoint for your data

```notes
- Also
```

---

Named terribly

```notes
- Quite good though, for a developer
```

---

A great way to see the shape of your data

# History lesson

###### (quick)

```notes
- Created 2012 by Dan Schafer, Nick Schrock and Lee Byron

- Around this time the whole industry was shifting to mobile

- GraphQL was created by Facebook get only the data needed into React components for the iOS app.


- Hierarchical: Another important aspect of GraphQL is its hierarchical nature.


- GraphQL naturally follows relationships between objects

- a RESTful service may require multiple round-trips (resource-intensive on mobile networks)

- or a complex join statement in SQL.

- Open Sourced 2015

- Single endpoint
```

export default Split

<StyledList>
  <StyledListItem title="true">REST API</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Multiple Endpoints (GET /users, POST /product, ...)
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>JSON Data is Exchanged</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Any Server-side Language, any frontend framework
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>Stateless</StyledListItem>
</StyledList>
<StyledList>
  <StyledListItem title="true">GraphQL API</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>One Endpoint Only (POST /graphql)</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>JSON Data is Exchanged</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Any Server-side Language, any frontend framework
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>Stateless</StyledListItem>
</StyledList>

```notes
- When talking about APIs here I mean web APIs exposed on a sever somewhere

- The difference is how you send the request to them

- REST APIs URL Driven

  - POST /user {name:'Scott'}

- GraphQL APIs Query Driven

  - POST /graphql {query:'query'}
```

# Why Gatsby? ü§î

```notes
- If you want things to happen fast Gatsby is "optimised out of the box".

- Built with performance in mind

- GraphQL was created by engineers at Facebook to help pull data needed data into React components.

- Based on popular and influential technology

- Fun to use and learn
```

# Speed

# üèé

Example, imagine your REST API is a vending machine and each piece of
data is one item on there you have to select individually and collect.

With GraphQL it enables a shopping list so you can get everything in
one go

## Since 2010

```notes
- Perf has been a factor in it's ranking algorithm

- That's not news, people are using mobile devices a lot more now,
  there are two indexes, desktop and mobile
```

# At build time outside of the data layer, using unstructured data.
