# History lesson

###### (quick)

```notes
- Created 2012 by three Facebook engineers

- Dan Schafer, Nick Schrock and Lee Byron

- Around this time the whole industry was shifting to mobile

- Facebook REST API was too big, slowing down mobile

- GraphQL was created by Facebook get only the data needed into React components for the iOS app.

- GraphQL naturally follows relationships between objects

- Hierarchical: Another important aspect of GraphQL is its hierarchical nature.

- a RESTful service may require multiple round-trips to get data needed

- or a complex join statement in SQL.

- (resource-intensive on mobile networks)

- Open Sourced 2015

# What's GraphQL? ü§î

---

export default Layout

# It's not

---

export default Layout

A library or a framework. export default Layout

---

export default Layout

A database technology.

---

export default Layout

# It is

---

export default Layout

A query language.

```notes
- What else would the QL stand for?
```

---

export default Layout

For querying APIs.

---

export default Layout

A single endpoint for your data

```notes
- Also
```

---

export default Layout

Named terribly

```notes
- Quite good though, for a developer
```

---

export default Layout

A great way to see the shape of your data

```notes
- as a developer

- Let's have comparison.
```

---

export default Split

<StyledList>
  <StyledListItem title="true">REST API</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Multiple Endpoints (GET /users, POST /product, ...)
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>JSON Data is Exchanged</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Any Server-side Language, any frontend framework
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>Stateless</StyledListItem>
</StyledList>
<StyledList>
  <StyledListItem title="true">GraphQL API</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>One Endpoint Only (POST /graphql)</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>JSON Data is Exchanged</StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>
    Any Server-side Language, any frontend framework
  </StyledListItem>
  <StyledListItem>Stateless</StyledListItem>
</StyledList>

```notes
- When talking about APIs here I mean web APIs exposed on a sever somewhere

- The difference is how you send the request to them

- REST APIs URL Driven

  - POST /user {name:'Scott'}

- GraphQL APIs Query Driven

  - POST /graphql {query:'query'}
```

# Example

---

export default Layout

<Icon file={'vending-machine.svg'} />

---

export default Layout

## Imagine your REST API is a vending machine

## You select data parts individually and collect.

---

export default Layout

<Icon file={'shopping-basket.svg'} />

---

export default Layout

## With GraphQL it's like enabling shopping basket

## so you can get everything in one go

# Why Gatsby? ü§î

```notes
- If you want things to happen fast Gatsby is "optimised out of the box".

- Built with performance in mind

- Based on popular and influential technology

- Fun to use and learn
```

# Speed

# üèé

---

export default Layout

# Perf

---

export default Layout

# People want things fast

---

export default Layout

<img
  height="200px"
  src={require('file-loader!./images/google-logo.svg')}
  alt="google logo"
/>

## Since 2010

```notes
- Perf has been a factor in it's ranking algorithm

- That's not news, people are using mobile devices a lot more now,
  there are two indexes, desktop and mobile
```

---

export default Layout

# How users interact with your site

# _could_ impact rankings

# Click through rates

# Time spent on page

# Return rate

```notes

# Bounce Rate & Conversions

## where it _really_ matters üí∑üí≥üí∏ü§ë

---

export default Layout

# How fast is fast enough?

---

export default Layout

# 2 seconds ‚è±

```notes
- this is where Gatsby comes in
```

---

export default Layout

Static means no work to be done at request time.

---

export default Layout

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

# Gatsby üíú's GraphQL

---

# GraphQL layer built in

---

# There are three main ways to get data into a Gatsby site.

# Build time

```notes
- Build time</h4>

- At build time using the Gatsby data layer.</li>
```

---

# At build time outside of the data layer, using unstructured data.

```notes
- Build time, outside data layer.

- Learn more about using unstructured data in Gatsby.
```

# At run time fetching from the client.
